## How to contribute
Once you have access, all you have to do is work on your assigned roles.

###On GitHub itself
Click on the index.html file in the 'Code' tab, and press the little pencil icon near the top right. This will open the edit menu. Please do not mess with the <link> or <script> tags, as those link the Javascript and CSS.

###In your own code editor (Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, etc.)
